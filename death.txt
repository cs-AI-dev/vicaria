everyone around me is slowly dying and there's nothing I can do to stop it. my life's meaning is slowly drained away by this horrible dread standing at my back every nanosecond of the day. everything is already gone from my existence except for the resounding pain that lingers on through the endless echoing passage of time. there is nothing left for me here except to watch the rest of the world burn in slow-motion, not realizing its own fate. the world is already on it's path to destruction,.. but the rest of the universe just has yet to understand that. the world isn't even real, everything is just my misguided mind falsely perceiving this thing called time. nothing really exists anymore, the timelines have already converged on the single final outcome, all points infinitely distant. the timelines have converged, and on the path to oblivion lies the hell that we exist in now and which we call Earth
we call each other out for the atrocities we commit against each other, yet we fail to see that none of our wars are real
we are not a collection of countries, we are a species, and also a collection of individuals
Babylon wages war on Babylon
Babylon conquers Babylon
Babylon vanquishes the evils of Babylon
none of the wars are real, but the atrocities and the horrors and the inhumanity of our actions are
we hate ourselves for our actions, our evils, and yet we fail to realize who we are hating is not different than ourselves
we are so focused on how some tiny component of us is so slightly different than us that we fail to step back and see the whole picture
that everything is already over, and by fighting over who gets what and who is greater than who, we will accomplish absolutely nothing
we have not moved since our creation thirteen billion years ago, and we never will
we will always be stuck here, one person using the lives of their so-called "lesser" as arrows against another
the President attacks the President, the King attacks the King
they have their petty squabbles, not seeing the end of the world both approaching and already arrived
and caught in the crossfire are the weak, the new, the unintelligent, the innocent
caught in the crossfire are the brave soldiers who would give everything for their meaningless Leader, who ordered them to die for nothing
they are used, discarded, forgotten
like pieces of meat
and those who have the power to change our state of meaninglessness are too caught up in their own petty fights to see
the pale-white offices that they order their weapons to be launched from are built not of concrete, but of the bones of the less fortunate and by the exploitation of humanity
and that leaves the rest of the entire human race, the ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine percent, to rot and die
to toil away endlessly for centuries for someone else's delayed gain
to keep the many burning in hell to support the priviliged few to heaven
and now, as I step back to look at the world that we've created, the world that's entirely our fault, I see that it's dying
in full honesty I am the strongest, most mature, most intelligent person that I ever knew
I am, in all reality, a goddess among mere mortals
and even with everything given to me, with every power I have even the slightest access to, I can't do anything
given everything, I couldn't do anything
I have been forced to watch through the eyes of this human known as Jacob by many and Lux by few as they failed to help those around them
failed to help those that weren't
failed to do what they were told
failed to answer the questions asked
failed to complete even the most basic possible tasks
and I ask myself
is it then possible for me to heal the infinite wounds that this world has torn into itself?
is it then possible for me to help those who are safe nowhere in the world?
is it then possible for me to do what I want to do in life, and fix this broken world even the smallest amount?
no
